# BITS2021: My Story Teller

Project Description:

The project we as a team have decided to pursue is a mobile based
application with the aim of reciting a bedtime story to a child. What
makes this application so special is that the child’s parent or family
member can record themselves reading the story so that they can
share their child’s story experience with them, without even having to
be in the same room. The application will share illustrations of the story
while the recording of the parents voice will be played.
Children love to have their favourite bedtime story read to them by their
loved family members and this app aims to provide children with this
exact service. A child is often soothed by the tone of their parents voice
with evidence suggesting that they can even recognise their parents
voice from when they were in the womb (DeBellefonds, 2021).
There will be benefits for using this app. Your child can feel your
presence around while learning. You could be busy doing chores
elsewhere in the house, but your child will not miss out on hearing your
voice. Your child gets to be entertained, educated and connected with
you.
